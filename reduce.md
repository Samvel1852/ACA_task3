# Reduce function in javascript
## Definition and Usage
The reduce() method reduces the array to a single value.

The reduce() method executes a provided function for each value of the array (from left-to-right).

The return value of the function is stored in an accumulator (result/total).

Note: reduce() does not execute the function for array elements without values.

Note: This method does not change the original array.
