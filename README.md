# Complex data types
### Introduction
The task is about the javascript complex data types, their usage and the working tools associated with them. Here are used function like:

- [join()](https://github.com/Samvel1852/ACA_task3/blob/main/join.md)
-   [split()](https://github.com/Samvel1852/ACA_task3/blob/main/split.md)
-   [reduce()](https://github.com/Samvel1852/ACA_task3/blob/main/reduce.md)
-   etc
### Definition 
Complex Data Type in JavaScript includes the typeof operator. The typeof operator is a unary operator that is placed before its single operand, which can be of any type. Its value is a string indicating the data type of the operand.

The typeof operator evaluates to "number", "string", or "boolean" if its operand is a number, string, or boolean value and returns true or false based on the evaluation.
The Objects you can declare with two vays:
``` javascript
-   let obj = {};
-   let obj = new Object();
```
There is a little only difference connected with the usage of the "new" keyword, most commonly uses first option.
With the same logic the arrays can be declared by two way:
```javascript
-   let arr = [];
-   let arr = newArray();
```
The difference here is that we can add also the size if needed in the second option but also most commonly uses the first option.
